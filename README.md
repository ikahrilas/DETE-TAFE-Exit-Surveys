# DETE-TAFE-Exit-Surveys
Project exploring exit survey data

I will be working with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training, and Employment (DETE) and Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. 

I intend to answer the following questions: 
- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? 
- What about employees who have been there longer? Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
